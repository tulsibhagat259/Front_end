10.What is the difference between a block-level element and an 
inline element? 


ans:-

Block-Level Elements

Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available, stretching out to the left and right as far as they can. They are used to structure the main content of a webpage. Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, and <table>.


ex:-<div>Hello World</div>



Inline Elements

Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are used within block-level elements to style or format specific parts of the content. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em>

ex:-<span>Hello World</span>
