8.How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? 

ans:-

Cell Padding
Space inside each cell — between the cell content and the cell border

Makes each cell’s content look less cramped

<table cellpadding="10">


Cell Spacing
Space between two different cells

Increases the gap between table cells

<table cellspacing="10">



example:-

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5">
  <tr>
    <td>Apple</td>
    <td>Banana</td>
  </tr>
</table>
