7.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

ans:

 	              ViewState	                                                                         SessionState
	              Store data for a single page	                                                 Store data for a user session (multiple pages)
	              Lost when the page is refreshed or moves to another page	                         Exists until browser is closed or session expires
	              Stored in the page itself (hidden field in the browser)	                         Stored on the server
	              Only available within the same page	                                         Available to all pages in the same session
	              Less secure (stored on client browser, can be viewed)	                         More secure (stored on server)
	              Limited (larger size slows page load)	                                         Can store more data (server memory limit)
	              Maintaining control values between postbacks	                                 Storing user login info, shopping cart items, etc.
	              Slower if too large (increases page weight)	                                 Faster for client but uses server memory
