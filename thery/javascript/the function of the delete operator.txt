13.What is the function of the delete operator? 

ans:

Deletes a property from an object

Returns true if deletion is successful

Does NOT delete variables declared with var, let, or const

Example 1: Deleting a property from an object
let person = {
    name: "Riya",
    age: 20
};

delete person.age;

console.log(person);
// { name: "Riya" }

Example 2: Deleting array elements

(Delete leaves an empty slot, not recommended)

let arr = [10, 20, 30];

delete arr[1];
