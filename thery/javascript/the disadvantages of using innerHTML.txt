17.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

ans:


1. It Replaces the Entire Content

When you use innerHTML, the browser removes all existing HTML inside the element and recreates it.

element.innerHTML += "<p>New item</p>";


Even this simple += causes:

Loss of previous event listeners

Re-rendering of the entire content

2. Security Risk (XSS Attacks)

If you insert user-provided content using innerHTML, it can execute malicious scripts.

Example:

innerHTML = "<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>";


This is why innerHTML is considered unsafe.

3. Slow Performance

Replacing HTML repeatedly causes:

More DOM operations

Slower rendering

Larger memory usage

Especially harmful for loops and big UI updates.

4. Removes Event Handlers

If the element had JavaScript events added using addEventListener(), they are removed.

Example:

btn.addEventListener("click", handler);
div.innerHTML = "...";
