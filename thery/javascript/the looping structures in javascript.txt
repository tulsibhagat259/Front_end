11.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

ans: 


1. for Loop

Used when you know how many times to run the loop.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. while Loop

Runs as long as the condition is true.

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. do...while Loop

Executes the code at least once, then checks the condition.

let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);

4. for...in Loop

Used to loop through object properties.

let person = { name: "Riya", age: 20 };

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}

5. for...of Loop

Used to loop through iterables like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.

let arr = [10, 20, 30];

for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value);
}

6. Array.forEach() Method

A built-in array method for looping.

let nums = [1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach(function(n) {
    console.log(n);
});
