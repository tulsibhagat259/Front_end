12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?
ans:
1. Follow a Consistent Naming Convention

Use predictable, readable class names.

BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a common method:

header__logo--small

This avoids conflicts and makes styles easier to understand.

2. Organize CSS Properly

Break CSS into logical sections:

Typography

Layout

Colors

Components

Utilities

Or use multiple CSS files for large projects.

3. Avoid Inline CSS

Inline styles are hard to maintain.
Use external CSS files instead:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

4. Use Comments

Comment complex rules or sections:

/* Navigation bar styles */
.nav { ... }


Helps future editing and teamwork.

5. Keep CSS DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

Avoid duplicating styles.
Use reusable classes instead of rewriting the same properties.
6. Validate CSS Using Validators

Use tools like W3C CSS Validator to check errors and maintain standards.

7. Use CSS Preprocessors (Optional)

Tools like SASS or LESS help organize styles better with:

Variables

Mixins

Nesting

(Though not part of CSS itself, they make maintenance easier.)

8. Test Across Browsers and Devices

Ensure the CSS works consistently on:

Chrome

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Mobile browsers
