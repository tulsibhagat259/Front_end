7.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
ans: 
1. repeat (default)

Repeats the image both horizontally and vertically.

background-repeat: repeat;

2. repeat-x

Repeats the image horizontally only.

background-repeat: repeat-x;

3. repeat-y

Repeats the image vertically only.

background-repeat: repeat-y;

4. no-repeat

Shows the image only once (no repeating).

background-repeat: no-repeat;

5. space

Repeats the image with equal spacing between images.

background-repeat: space;

6. round

Resizes the image so it repeats without being cut.

background-repeat: round;

✅ Example
body {
    background-image: url("image.jpg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
