5.What do you understand by CSS opacity? 
ans:CSS Opacity

The opacity property in CSS determines how transparent or visible an element is.

It takes a value between:

1 → fully visible (100% opaque)

0 → completely invisible (100% transparent)

Example values:

opacity: 1; → no transparency

opacity: 0.5; → 50% transparent

opacity: 0; → invisible

Example
.box {
    opacity: 0.6;
}


6. How can the background color of an element be changed? 
ans:
Syntax
selector {
    background-color: color;
}

 Example
div {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

1. Named colors
background-color: red;

2. HEX values
background-color: #ff5733;

3. RGB
background-color: rgb(255, 99, 71);

4. RGBA (with transparency)
background-color: rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);

5. HSL
background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);



7.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
ans: 
1. repeat (default)

Repeats the image both horizontally and vertically.

background-repeat: repeat;

2. repeat-x

Repeats the image horizontally only.

background-repeat: repeat-x;

3. repeat-y

Repeats the image vertically only.

background-repeat: repeat-y;

4. no-repeat

Shows the image only once (no repeating).

background-repeat: no-repeat;

5. space

Repeats the image with equal spacing between images.

background-repeat: space;

6. round

Resizes the image so it repeats without being cut.

background-repeat: round;

✅ Example
body {
    background-image: url("image.jpg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}


8. What is the use of the background-position property? 
ans:
background-position

It controls where the background image appears—such as top, bottom, center, left, right, or even specific pixel/percentage positions.

✅ Syntax
background-position: value;

✅ Common Values
1. Keyword values
background-position: top left;
background-position: center;
background-position: bottom right;

2. Percentage values
background-position: 50% 50%;    /* center */
background-position: 0% 100%;    /* bottom-left */

3. Pixel values
background-position: 10px 20px;  /* 10px from left, 20px from top */

4. Mixed values
background-position: right 10px top 20px;

✅ Example
div {
    background-image: url("sky.jpg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
}


9.Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
ans:
1. scroll (default)

The background image moves when the page is scrolled.

background-attachment: scroll;

2. fixed

The background image stays fixed in place even when the page scrolls.

background-attachment: fixed;

3. local

The background image scrolls with the element’s content (useful for scrollable containers).

background-attachment: local;

✅ Example
body {
    background-image: url("image.jpg");
    background-attachment: fixed;
}

10.Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
ans:color → controls text color

background → controls background color, image, repeat, size, etc.

11. How to center block elements using CSS1? 
ans:The block element must have a specified width.

Setting left and right margins to auto distributes the remaining horizontal space equally, centering the element.

ex.div {
    width: 300px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?
ans:
1. Follow a Consistent Naming Convention

Use predictable, readable class names.

BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a common method:

header__logo--small

This avoids conflicts and makes styles easier to understand.

✅ 2. Organize CSS Properly

Break CSS into logical sections:

Typography

Layout

Colors

Components

Utilities

Or use multiple CSS files for large projects.

✅ 3. Avoid Inline CSS

Inline styles are hard to maintain.
Use external CSS files instead:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

✅ 4. Use Comments

Comment complex rules or sections:

/* Navigation bar styles */
.nav { ... }


Helps future editing and teamwork.

✅ 5. Keep CSS DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

Avoid duplicating styles.
Use reusable classes instead of rewriting the same properties.

✅ 6. Validate CSS Using Validators

Use tools like W3C CSS Validator to check errors and maintain standards.

✅ 7. Use CSS Preprocessors (Optional)

Tools like SASS or LESS help organize styles better with:

Variables

Mixins

Nesting

(Though not part of CSS itself, they make maintenance easier.)

✅ 8. Test Across Browsers and Devices

Ensure the CSS works consistently on:

Chrome

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Mobile browsers




13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? 
ans:
1. Inline CSS
<p style="color: blue;">This is inline CSS.</p>

2. Internal CSS (Embedded)
<head>
<style>
  p { color: red; }
</style>
</head>

3. External CSS
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


14. What is embedded style sheets?
ans:When you want to style only one web page.

    When you need quick or page-specific styling.

    When external CSS is not necessary.

  ex.<head>
<style>
  h1 {
    color: blue;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
</head>



15.What are the external style sheets? 
ans:One CSS file can style many pages.

Easy to update and maintain.

Cleaner HTML structure.

ex.HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


CSS (styles.css):

h1 {
  color: green;
}




16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
ans:Advantages of External Style Sheets
1. Consistency Across Web Pages
A single CSS file can style multiple HTML pages, ensuring a uniform look across the entire website.

2. Easy Maintenance
You only need to edit one CSS file to update the design of the entire site.

3. Cleaner HTML Code
HTML remains neat because all styling is kept separate from the content.

4. Faster Page Loading
Browsers cache the external CSS file, so it loads faster on subsequent pages.

5. Reusability
The same stylesheet can be reused in different projects or pages.

❌ Disadvantages of External Style Sheets
1. Requires an Extra HTTP Request
When the page loads, the browser must fetch the external CSS file, which may cause a slight delay.

2. Pages May Load Unstyled Initially
If the CSS file loads slowly, the page may appear without styling for a moment (flash of unstyled content).

3. No Offline Styling
If the user is offline or the CSS file is missing, the page will not show the intended styles.

4. More Complex for Small Projects
For very small pages, using an external stylesheet may be unnecessary compared to inline or internal CSS.




17.What is the meaning of the CSS selector? 
ans:Element selector (p, h1)

Class selector (.title)

ID selector (#header)

Universal selector (*)

Attribute selector (input[type="text"])

Pseudo-class selector (a:hover)

Pseudo-element selector (::before)

ex.p {
  color: red;
}



18.What are the media types allowed by CSS?
ans:1. all

Used for all media types (default).

2. screen

For computer screens, tablets, smartphones, etc.

3. print

For printed documents or print preview mode.

4. speech

For screen readers that read content aloud.


19.What is the rule set?
ans:A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

Selector 

Declaration block

Declaration

✅ Example of a Rule Set
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
}
